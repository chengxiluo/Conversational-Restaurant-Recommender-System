# Conversational-Restaurant-Recommender-System1
Conversational agents are used widely in e-commerce websites to interact with customers and help them solve questions
and find products. Recommendation is also an essential feature of e-commerce websites, which help customers discover
more interesting products. In this paper, we implement a Conversational Restaurant Recommender System(CRRS), which
combines the conversational agent and recommender system
together. We also evaluate the performance of CRRS by a laboratory experiment. Our result shows that CRRS is an efficient
tool, which always recommends suitable restaurants based on
our usersâ€™ needs.
